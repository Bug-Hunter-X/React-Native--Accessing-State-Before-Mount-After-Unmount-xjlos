This error occurs when you try to access a property of a component's state before the component has mounted or after it has unmounted. This is a common issue in React Native apps that involve asynchronous operations or user interactions that might happen before the component's state is fully initialized.  For example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    // This will cause an error if accessed before the data is fetched
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text> {/* Error prone line */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
The `this.state.data.name` access in `render()` might attempt to access `data` before the `fetch` call in `componentDidMount` completes.  This causes a runtime error because `this.state.data` will be `null` initially.
